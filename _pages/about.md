## About Me

I completed my Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science at the University of Science in
Vietnam, advised by Assoc. Prof. Dien Dinh. My bachelorâ€™s thesis focused on Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Theoretical Linguistics, in which I integrated the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)
semantic graph into Neural Machine Translation. After graduating, I worked in the IT industry for more
than one year as an AI Engineer. Meanwhile, I am also a research assistant at the Computational Linguistic
Center (HCMUS), advised by Assoc. Prof. Dien Dinh. My research interests include machine translation,
language modeling, and QA.
