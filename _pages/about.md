## About Me

I completed my Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science at the [University of Science](https://hcmus.edu.vn/) in
Vietnam, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Dien Dinh](http://www.clc.hcmus.edu.vn/ddien). My bachelorâ€™s thesis focused on Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Theoretical Linguistics, in which I integrated the [Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)](https://amr.isi.edu/)
semantic graph into Neural Machine Translation. After graduating, I worked in the IT industry for more
than one year as an AI Engineer. Meanwhile, I am also a research assistant at the [Computational Linguistic
Center (HCMUS)](http://www.clc.hcmus.edu.vn/), advised by Assoc. Prof. Dien Dinh. My research interests include machine translation,
language modeling, and QA.
